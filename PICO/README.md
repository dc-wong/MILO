"blink" and "hello_world" are simple and built-in programs as found in this link: https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf

"LED_Blink" is a script that will use pin 1 (GPIO pin 0) to turn on and off an LED.

All scripts are fairly straight forward and tje circuitry for "LED_Blink" is not complicated. The only things that are needed is 2 wires, a resistor, and a LED.
